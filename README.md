# Introduction

Authentication and authorization are two critical concepts in security systems, especially in applications that handle sensitive data. Although they are closely related and often mentioned together, they serve different purposes. Understanding the distinction between them is key to designing secure systems.

## Definitions

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It answers the question, "Who are you?" When you log in to a website using a username and password, the system checks whether your credentials match those on file, confirming your identity.

**Authorization** is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It answers the question, "What can you do?" Once you're authenticated, the system then checks your permissions to determine which resources you can access and which actions you can perform.

In simple terms:

- **Authentication** = Identity verification.
- **Authorization** = Permission verification.

Both processes are interconnected but distinct. Authentication always comes firstâ€”once the system knows who you are, it can decide what you're allowed to do through authorization.

## Depth of Analysis

In the example of the delete user case, it is true that it has used an authentication and authorization system. But if the implementation is wrong, it will have a bad impact on the system that has been created. The example uses the wrong authorization system because it allows any user to be able to delete all users based on their username. This will cause chaos in the running system, for example they can delete the administrator account or even accidentally delete their own account.

## Conclusion

Authentication and authorization are different but complementary processes in a security system. Authentication verifies who you are, while authorization determines what you can do. By breaking these concepts down into clear definitions, the differences between the two become easier to understand and can be applied appropriately.
